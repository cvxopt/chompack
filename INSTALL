Installation instructions for the Python interface to CHOMPACK version 1.1.1.

The package requires version 2.5 or newer of Python, and is built from
source, so the header files and libraries for Python must be installed,
as well as the core binaries.  

The installation requires the source distribution of CVXOPT version 1.1.3,
and either ATLAS or BLAS + LAPACK.  Using architecture optimized ATLAS 
libraries is recommended and gives a large performance improvement over 
standard BLAS & LAPACK libraries.  Both header files and libraries must 
be installed.


Configuration script:
---------------------
Edit setup.py and update the following variables:

- CVXOPT_SRC: the path to the 'src' directory in the CVXOPT distribution.

- ATLAS_LIB_DIR: the directory containing the LAPACK and BLAS libraries.


Compilation:
------------
chompack can be installed globally (for all users on a UNIX system) by
writing:

    python setup.py install

It can also be installed locally in the home directory by typing:

    python setup.py install --home=~

This will install the libraries in /home/username/lib/python. In this
case PYTHONPATH must be updated, e.g., under Bash write

    export PYTHONPATH = $PYTHONPATH:/home/username/lib/python
