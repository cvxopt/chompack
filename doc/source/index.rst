Chordal Matrix Packageâ€”a library for chordal matrix computations
======================================================================

Chompack is a library for chordal matrix computations.  It includes
routines for:

  - symbolic factorization
  - numeric Cholesky factorization
  - forward and back substitution
  - maximum determinant positive definite completion
  - minimum rank completion
  - Euclidean distance matrix completion
  - computations with logarithmic barriers for sparse matrix cones
  - chordal conversion 
  - computing a maximal chordal subgraph

The implementation is based on the supernodal-multifrontal algorithms
described in these papers:

Applications of these algorithms in optimization include sparse matrix cone programs,
covariance selection, graphical models, and decomposition and relaxation methods.
