Chordal Matrix Packageâ€”a library for chordal matrix computations
======================================================================

Chompack is a library for chordal matrix computations.  It includes
routines for 

  - symbolic factorization;
  - numeric Cholesky factorization;
  - forward and back substitution;
  - maximum determinant positive definite completion;
  - computations with logarithmic barriers for sparse matrix cones;
  - chordal conversion;
  - computing maximal chordal subgraph.

The implementation is based on the supernodal-multifrontal algorithms
described in this paper:

      for sparse matrix cones <http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2742>`_, *Optimization Methods and Software*, 2013.

Applications of these algorithms in optimization include sparse matrix cone programs,
covariance selection, graphical models, and decomposition and relaxation methods.
